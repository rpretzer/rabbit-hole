  "description": "A personal portfolio site built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and a lightweight file-based CMS. Features the Quiet Geometry design system—restrained typography, muted liturgical neutrals, and intentional spacing. Supports poetry manuscripts with PDF viewing, artwork galleries, and a minimal content management interface. No frameworks, no build tools, just deliberate design and careful code.",
