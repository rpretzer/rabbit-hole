  "fullText": "And tobacco stained fingertips tremble restlessly.\nAnd the charcoal pencil rolls across the desk and through the ash piles with every carriage return.\n\nAnd dissolution.\n\nIt is liminal space, neither wakefulness nor sleep\n\nWhere we rewrite hymns.\nWhere we unveil, transform glory to glory.\nWhere we commune and expel the godhead from our chest.\nWhere we spread our slick viscera on the sand in spirals and chant silently of our naked being.",
