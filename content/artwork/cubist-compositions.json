  "description": "Fragmented explorations of everyday moments—a man in a cafe, eating, drinking coffee—reconstructed through geometric abstraction. These compositions draw from early 20th century Cubism's deconstruction of perspective, breaking the singular viewpoint into multiple simultaneous planes. The works engage with the flattening and reconstruction of observed reality, creating a visual rhythm that suggests the movement and multiplicity inherent in a simple moment. Cleveland serves as both setting and departure point for these abstracted recollections.",
