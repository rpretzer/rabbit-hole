# Polyrhythmic Verses

*Poetry | A collection*

Poetry loosely cadenced on Latin jazz polyrhythms, exploring transformation, loss, and remembrance through assonant slant rhymes in liminal spaces between sleeping and waking.

## Morning Montuno

*4/4 over 3/4 time signature*

Coffee steam spirals through             
the space where certainty              
used to live—now just                  
tremolo fingers on porcelain,         
memory's tumbao bass line              
walking through kitchen light.         

I count the polyrhythm:                
heartbeat, breath, clock tick,         
the syncopated silence                 
where your voice                       
still hangs                           
like suspended chords.                 

Some mornings I wake to find           
the melody changed                     
but the changes, ah—                   
the changes stay the same.

## Transformation Clave

*In 3-2 clave pattern*

THREE beats: morning, noon, the space between—
TWO beats: who I was, who I'm becoming.

Change arrives like                    
unexpected percussion,                 
off-beat but on-purpose,              
disrupting the comfortable             
four-four march of                     
routine and responsibility.            

I'm learning to improvise              
over the standard progressions:        
C major to somewhere                   
unfamiliar, hands finding              
new fingerings for old songs,          
voice stretching into registers        
I didn't know I had.                   

The bridge modulates                   
and suddenly I'm                       
not the same person                    
who started this song.

## Loss in 6/8

*Compound time, felt in 2*

Everything important                   
moves in threes now:                   
inhale, hold, release—                
remember, grieve, let go—              
morning, afternoon, the long           
shadow that evening casts              
across familiar rooms.                 

Your absence keeps                     
perfect time,                         
reliable as a metronome               
I can't turn off.                     

But listen: underneath               
the steady pulse of missing           
something syncopated                  
starts to emerge—                     
a new rhythm made of                  
empty spaces learning                 
to sound like possibility.

## Design System Blues

*12-bar progression in the key of change management*

I got the enterprise blues,            
fifty teams and they all refuse        
to use the components I designed.      

I got those stakeholder blues,         
requirements that shift and cruise     
through every meeting like smoke.      

But when the system starts to swing,   
when adoption starts to sing           
those sweet collaborative harmonies—   

That's when the blues                  
become the music                       
we were meant to make.

## Michigan Nocturne

*Rubato tempo, dreamlike*

In Kalamazoo we learned                
that poverty has its own               
complex time signature:                
feast, famine, and the space           
between where creativity               
grows wild like dandelions             
through sidewalk cracks.               

Hippie parents who never              
quite grew up, just got                
tired of trying to explain            
why normal felt like                   
wearing someone else's clothes.        

Now in Cleveland I practice            
the same odd rhythms:                  
stubborn persistence in               
leo fire time,                        
generous midwestern                    
four-four kindness                    
over latin jazz                       
polyrhythm ambition.                  

Some nights I dream                   
in both time signatures              
simultaneously,                       
and wake up knowing                   
exactly who I am.

## Agile Manifesto Variations

*Theme and variations on a business theme*

**Theme**: Individuals over process
**Variation 1**: Relationships over adherence  
**Variation 2**: Outcomes over methodology
**Variation 3**: Jazz over classical

We tried to play it straight,         
metronomic sprints and                
perfectly documented user stories,    
but the music kept wanting            
to break free into improvisation.     

So we learned to jam:                 
loose structure, tight listening,     
everyone gets a solo but              
nobody forgets the song.              

Retrospectives became                 
sessions where we practiced           
playing together better,              
not just playing the parts            
we were assigned.

## Slant Rhyme for Liminal Spaces

*Free time, conversational*

Between sleeping and waking           
there's a moment when                 
all the day's certainties            
soften into maybe,                   
when the boundary between             
dreaming and designing               
dissolves like sugar                 
in morning coffee.                   

I do my best thinking               
in these threshold spaces:          
airplane takeoffs,                  
shower steam,                       
the pause between                   
question and answer.                

Here, in the liminal,               
transformation feels                
less like work and more             
like coming home                    
to a song I've been                 
humming all my life                 
without knowing the words.

## Cleveland Coda

*Ritardando, ending in major*

This city taught me                   
that reinvention                     
doesn't require                      
abandoning what came before—         
just learning to play               
the same melody                     
in a different key.                 

Lake Erie keeps time                
like a patient bassist,             
steady beneath all                  
our urgent improvisations.          

Some evenings the whole city        
feels like one big session:         
everyone playing their part,        
some of us in tune,                 
all of us trying                    
to make something beautiful         
from what we've been given.         

*Fade to silence*

*Notes on composition: These verses were written during morning practice sessions, coffee in hand, listening to the polyrhythmic patterns of city life outside my Cleveland windows. The poems attempt to capture the syncopated experience of transformation—how change rarely follows the steady 4/4 time we expect, but creates its own complex rhythms that eventually resolve into something that feels like home.*
