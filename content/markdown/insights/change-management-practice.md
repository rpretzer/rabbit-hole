# Change Management as Practice

*Article | 8 min read*

Simple, fundamental messages win when we're purposeful about finding common interest and learning to vibe with contextual background noise. Change management isn't about perfecting process—it's about making things work better for actual people.

## The Myth of Perfect Process

Too often, change initiatives fail because they prioritize adherence to methodology over outcomes. I've seen Fortune 500 companies spend months crafting the "perfect" change management framework, only to watch it crumble when it meets the reality of how people actually work.

The truth? **Outcomes and relationships trump process and adherence.**

## Finding Common Ground

In my 15+ years working with companies like USAA, Progressive, and MVP Healthcare, the most successful transformations happened when we:

- **Started with shared problems**, not solutions
- **Listened to resistance** as valuable data
- **Adapted methodology** to organizational culture
- **Measured relationship health** alongside deliverables

## The Background Noise Problem

Every organization has contextual background noise—the unspoken dynamics, historical tensions, and informal power structures that influence how change really happens. Most change management approaches try to eliminate this noise. 

**Better approach**: Learn to vibe with it.

### Recognizing the Patterns

- **The eye-roll during all-hands meetings** (translation: "here we go again")
- **The "sounds great, but..." responses** (translation: "I've seen this before")
- **The sudden enthusiasm for old processes** (translation: "I'm scared of losing what I know")

## Practical Change as Practice

Change management works best as a practice, not a project. Like jazz improvisation, it requires:

1. **Strong fundamentals** (know your frameworks)
2. **Deep listening** (to the organization's rhythm)
3. **Responsive adaptation** (when the melody changes)
4. **Collaborative creation** (everyone gets to contribute)

### The Michigan Grit Approach

Growing up poor and quasi-feral in Kalamazoo taught me that survival requires:
- **Resourcefulness over resources**
- **Relationships over rules**
- **Persistence over perfection**
- **Solutions over systems**

This translates directly to change work. The goal isn't elegant methodology—it's sustainable transformation that sticks.

## Case Study: Design System Adoption

At USAA, we needed to get 50+ development teams to adopt a new mobile design system. The traditional approach would have been:
1. Build perfect documentation
2. Mandate adoption
3. Train everyone
4. Measure compliance

**What we did instead:**
1. Found the team with the biggest pain point
2. Solved their specific problem first
3. Let them become advocates
4. Built adoption through peer influence

**Result**: 80% adoption in 6 months vs. the projected 18-month rollout.

## The Win-Win Imperative

Every change initiative creates winners and losers. The art is in finding compromises that feel like wins for everyone involved—even when they're not perfect solutions.

### Questions I Ask:
- What does success look like for each stakeholder?
- Where are the natural alignment points?
- What fears need to be addressed before moving forward?
- How can we make the transition feel collaborative, not imposed?

## Beyond Process: Building Practice

**Process** is what you do when everything goes according to plan.
**Practice** is how you respond when it doesn't.

The best change agents develop practices that can adapt to context while maintaining integrity of purpose. This means:

- **Holding outcomes lightly** while staying committed to direction
- **Reading organizational energy** and adjusting timing accordingly
- **Building coalition** through conversation, not presentation
- **Celebrating small wins** that demonstrate new possibilities

## The Poetry of Change

There's a rhythm to organizational change that's more like Latin jazz than classical music. It's polyrhythmic—multiple patterns happening simultaneously, sometimes in tension, sometimes in harmony.

Successful change management means learning to conduct this orchestra without losing the essential human elements that make the music worth playing.
