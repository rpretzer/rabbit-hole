I'm a product design consultant who brings a unique perspective from the insurance and financial services world. Over 15+ years, I've worked with Fortune 500 companies like Progressive Insurance, USAA, Volkswagen Credit, and MVP Healthcare, focusing on mobile applications, design systems, and business process transformation.

My approach combines deep experience in legal tech, mobile product ownership, and agile coaching. I've been called a "dynamic change agent" because I take seriously the role of challenging ways of working, promoting with purpose, and finding ways to compromise to a win-win. I believe outcomes and relationships trump process and adherence.

Born and raised in Kalamazoo, Michigan – grew up poor and quasi-feral with hippie parents who never grew out of it, they just got tired. That pure Michigan grit runs deep: mental toughness, resilience, and a "do whatever the hell I want" attitude balanced with Midwestern generosity and openness. Now based in Cleveland, Ohio, but I carry that Michigan spirit in everything I do.

When I'm not working, you can find me writing poetry influenced by Latin jazz polyrhythms, obsessing over hi-fi audio equipment, traveling to new places with my family, and engaging in purposeful distraction to stimulate creativity. Leo born in the year of the dog (1982) – fire sign energy with loyal, stubborn persistence.
