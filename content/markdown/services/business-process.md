# Transform Your Business Processes

## Overview
Business process design isn't about creating perfect workflows on paper—it's about understanding how people actually work and designing systems that amplify their strengths while minimizing friction. After 15+ years transforming processes at Fortune 500 companies, I've learned that sustainable improvement happens when you solve human problems, not just business problems.

## Approach

### Human-Centered Design
I start with the people who do the work every day. Through observation, interviews, and collaborative workshops, I understand not just the official process, but how work actually gets done—including the workarounds and shadow processes that keep things moving.

### Technology as Enabler
Technology should make work easier, not harder. I design processes that leverage technology to eliminate repetitive tasks, reduce errors, and free people to focus on high-value activities that require human judgment and creativity.

### Sustainable Change
Process improvement isn't a one-time event—it's an ongoing practice. I build in feedback loops, performance metrics, and governance structures that enable continuous refinement based on real-world usage.
