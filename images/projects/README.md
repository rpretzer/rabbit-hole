## Adding Screenshots

1. Add your screenshot images to the appropriate project directory
2. Name them according to the paths specified in the project JSON files:
   - `content/projects/project-dawn.json`
   - `content/projects/agentic-job-pipeline.json`
   - `content/projects/starfox-cal.json`
3. Update the `alt` text and optional `caption` fields in the JSON files to describe each screenshot

## Image Guidelines

- Recommended format: PNG or JPG
- Recommended aspect ratio: 16:9 for consistency
- File size: Optimize images for web (aim for < 500KB per image)
- The modal will display images with pinch-to-zoom support on mobile devices
