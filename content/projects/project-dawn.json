  "summaryDescription": "Project Dawn is a decentralized AI node built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It reimagines the \"Large Language Model\" not as a centralized corporate service, but as a distributed, SETI-inspired mesh. By utilizing a P2P-sharded architecture, it allows individual nodes to contribute idle compute cycles to a collective network—creating a powerful, resilient AI that lives on the edge, not in a data center.",
