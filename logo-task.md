# Logo Design Task

## Status
**Separate task** - Not yet started

## Requirements
- Need a professional logo for Ryan Pretzer / RSP Management LLC
- Should work well at various sizes (favicon, header, print)
- Should align with the clean, minimal design aesthetic of the site

## Current State
- Site currently uses `logo-primary.svg` (placeholder/minimal)
- Logo appears in header navigation on all pages
- Needs to be professional but not overly corporate

## Considerations
- Brand identity: Product leadership, clarity, simplicity
- Color scheme: Works with light/dark mode
- Formats needed: SVG (primary), possibly PNG variants
- Usage: Header logo, favicon, social profiles

## Next Steps
1. Design concepts/brief
2. Create logo variations
3. Implement across site
4. Update favicon
5. Create social media profile versions
